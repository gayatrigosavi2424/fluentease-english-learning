🤖 AI Grammar & Fluency Analysis

Found 6 issues:

❌ '  ' → ✅ ' ' (It seems like there are too many consecutive spaces here.)
❌ '  ' → ✅ ' ' (It seems like there are too many consecutive spaces here.)
❌ 'an inner rupees' → ✅ 'an inner rupee' (The plural noun "rupees" cannot be used with the article "an". Did you mean "an inner rupee" or "inner rupees"?)
❌ 'plan' → ✅ 'planned' (Consider using either the past participle "planned" or the present participle "planning" here.)
❌ 'singing singing' → ✅ 'singing' (Possible typo: you repeated a word.)
❌ 'favourite' → ✅ 'Favorite' (Possible spelling mistake. 'favourite' is British English.)
